developement instance, UAT instance and Production Instance

It is possible to customize the UI and Branding of the page, to give a customized feel for the application

## ServiceNow has Role Based Access

There are four kind of role-based access in the ServieNow portal 
    -   User
    -   Group 
    -   Role
    -   Base System Role

BEST PRACTICE: Assign the role to a group and sub-groups, and not to the individual user, this can be used to ensure 
    optimal way of securing the information by practicing role access

########TRIVIA: 
        1. Users without any assigned role permissions can still log in to ServiceNow and access common actions, 
        such as viewing a homepage, accessing the Service Catalog, viewing knowledge articles, and taking 
        surveys. These are often referred to as self-service users.

        2. When roles are assigned that change a user's access permissions for the current session, 
        the user would need to log out and log back in before the new permissions take effect.


## USER AUTHENTICATION
    User Authentication is the first level of security applied. It validates the identity of the user trying to 
    access the instance. After taht you can access the roles attached to that user

Diffrent types of User Authentication:
    -   Local Database
    -   External Sign on (SSO)
    -   LDAP
    -   OAuth2.0
    -   Digest Token
    -   MultiFactor

##### NOTE: 
            Elevate Role:  Elevate Roles provides an extra layer of precaution for powerful roles. 
            Administrators often use it when modifying high security settings.
            
            Elevate Roles prevents accidents caused by forgetting the power of owning an important role, 
            such as security_admin. It requires you to manually accept that responsibility before using it.
